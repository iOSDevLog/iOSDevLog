		Heuristic: the chance of winning soon is related to the number and length
		of N-in-a-row runs of chips. For example, a player with two runs of two chips each
		is more likely to win soon than a player with no runs.
	 
		Scoring should weigh the player's chance of success against that of failure,
		which in a two-player game means success for the opponent. Sum the player's number
		and size of runs, and subtract from it the same score for the opponent.
	 
	 	This is not the best possible heuristic for Four-In-A-Row, but it produces
		moderately strong gameplay. Try these improvements:
			- Account for "broken runs"; e.g. a row of two chips, then a space, then a third chip.
			- Weight the run lengths; e.g. two runs of three is better than three runs of two.
