    The \c AAPLConnectivityListsControllerDelegate protocol enables an \c AAPLConnectivityListsController

    that the \c AAPLListsController can call these methods on an aribitrary queue. If the implementation in 
    these methods require UI manipulations, you should respond to the changes on the main queue.
