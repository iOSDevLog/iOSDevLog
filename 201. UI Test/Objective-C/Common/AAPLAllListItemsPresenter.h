/*!
    The \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter list presenter class is responsible for managing how a list is displayed
    in both the iOS and OS X apps. The \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter class conforms to \c AAPLListPresenting so
    consumers of this class can work with the presenter with a common interface.

    When a list is presented with an \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter, all of the list items with a list are
    presented as the name suggests!). When the list items are displayed to a user, the incomplete list items
    are ordered before the complete list items. This order is determined when \c -setList: is called on the \c
    AAPLAllListItemsPresenter instance. The presenter then reorders the list items accordingly, calling the
    delegate methods with any relevant changes.

    An \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter can be interacted with in a few ways. It can insert, remove, toggle, move,
    and update list items. It can also change the color of the presented list. All of these changes get
    funnelled through callbacks to the delegate (an \c AAPLListPresenterDelegate). For more information about
    how the delegate pattern for the \c AAPLListPresenting instance is architected, see the \c
    AAPLListPresenting definition.  What's unique about the \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter with respect to the
    delegate methods is that the \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter has an undo manager. Whenever the presentation of
    the list is manipulated (as described above), the presenter pushes an undo operation that reverses the
    manipulation onto the undo stack.  For example, if a list item is inserted, the \c
    AAPLAllListItemsPresenter instance registers an undo operation to remove the list item. When a user
    performs an undo in either the iOS or OS X app, the list item that was inserted is removed. The remove
    operation gets funnelled into the same delegate that inserted the list item. By abstracting these
    operations away into a presenter and delegate architecture, we're not only able to easily test the code
    that manipulates the list, but we're also able to test the undo registration code.

    One thing to note is that when a list item is toggled in the \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter, it is moved from
    an index in its current completion state to an index opposite of the list items completion state. For
    example, if a list item that is complete is toggled, it will move to an incomplete index (e.g. index 0).
    For the \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter, a toggle represents both the list item moving as well as the list
    item being updated.
