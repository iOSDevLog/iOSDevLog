    Abstract:
    The definition for the \c AAPLListPresenterDelegate type. This protocol defines the contract between the \c AAPLListPresenting interactions and receivers of those events (the type that conforms to the \c AAPLListPresenterDelegate protocol).
*/

@protocol AAPLListPresenting;

/*!
    The \c AAPLListPresenterDelegate type is used to receive events from an \c AAPLListPresenting instance
    about updates to the presenter's layout. This happens, for example, if an \c AAPLListItem object is
    inserted into the list or removed from the list. For any change that occurs to the list, a delegate message
    can be called, but you may decide not to take any action if the method doesn’t apply to your use case. For
    an implementation of \c AAPLListPresenterDelegate, see the \c AAPLAllListItemsPresenter or \c
    AAPLIncompleteListItemsPresenter types.

/*!
    An \c AAPLListPresenting instance invokes this method on its delegate when a large change to the underlying
    list changed, but the presenter couldn't resolve the granular changes. A full layout change includes
    changing anything on the underlying list: list item toggling, text updates, color changes, etc. This is
    invoked, for example, when the list is initially loaded, because there could be many changes that happened
    relative to an empty list--the delegate should just reload everything immediately. This method is not
    wrapped in \c -listPresenterWillChangeListLayout:isInitialLayout: and \c
    -listPresenterDidChangeListLayout:isInitialLayout: method invocations.

    The list presenter whose full layout has changed.

    the new list is being presented for the first time--for example, if \c -setList: is called on the \c AAPLListPresenting
    instance, the delegate will receive a \c -listPresenterWillChangeListLayout:isInitialLayout: call where
