    The \c AAPLList class manages the color of a list and each \c AAPLListItem, including the order of
    the list. Incomplete items are located at the start of the items array, followed by complete list
    items. There are many convenience methods on the \c AAPLList class to query whether an item can be
    moved or inserted at a certain index, to perform those move and insert operations, to toggle an
    item between a complete and incomplete state, and to fetch list items by index. Note that in order
    to be able to archive and unarchive \c AAPLList objects in both the Objective-C and Swift versions
    of the app, the Swift version of the app ensures that the runtime name of its \c List object is
    also \c AAPLList.
