    An \c AAPLListItem object is composed of a text property, a completion status, and an underlying
    opaque identity that distinguishes one \c AAPLListItem object from another. Note that in order to
    be able to archive and unarchive \c AAPLListItem objects in both the Objective-C and Swift versions
    of the app, the Swift version of the app ensures that the runtime name of its \c AAPLListItem object
    is also \c AAPLListItem.
