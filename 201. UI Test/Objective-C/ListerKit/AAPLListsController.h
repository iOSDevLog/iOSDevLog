    Abstract:
    The \c AAPLListsController and \c AAPLListsControllerDelegate infrastructure provide a mechanism for other objects within the application to be notified of inserts, removes, and updates to \c AAPLListInfo objects. In addition, it also provides a way for parts of the application to present errors that occured when creating or removing lists.

/*!
    The \c AAPLListsControllerDelegate protocol enables an \c AAPLListsController object to notify other
    objects of changes to available \c AAPLListInfo objects. This includes "will change content" events,
    "did change content" events, inserts, removes, updates, and errors. Note that the \c AAPLListsController
    can call these methods on an aribitrary queue. If the implementation in these methods require UI
    manipulations, you should respond to the changes on the main queue.

/*!
    The \c AAPLListsController class is responsible for tracking \c AAPLListInfo objects that are found through
    lists controller's \c AAPLListCoordinator object. \c AAPLListCoordinator objects are responsible for
    notifying the lists controller of inserts, removes, updates, and errors when interacting with a list's
    URL. Since the work of searching, removing, inserting, and updating \c AAPLListInfo objects is done
    by the lists controller's coordinator, the lists controller serves as a way to avoid the need to interact
    with a single \c AAPLListCoordinator directly throughout the application. It also allows the rest
    of the application to deal with \c AAPLListInfo objects rather than dealing with their \c NSURL
    instances directly. In essence, the work of a lists controller is to "front" its current coordinator.
    All changes that the coordinator relays to the \c AAPLListsController object will be relayed to the
    lists controller's delegate. This ability to front another object is particularly useful when the
    underlying coordinator changes. As an example, this could happen when the user changes their storage
    option from using local documents to using cloud documents. If the coordinator property of the list
    controller changes, other objects throughout the application are unaffected since the lists controller 
    will notify them of the appropriate changes (removes, inserts, etc.).
