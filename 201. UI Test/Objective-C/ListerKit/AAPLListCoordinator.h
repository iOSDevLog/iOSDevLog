    The \c AAPLListCoordinator and \c AAPLListCoordinatorDelegate protocols provide the infrastructure to send updates to an \c AAPLListsController object, abstracting away the need to worry about the underlying storage mechanism.

@import Foundation;

@class AAPLList;
@protocol AAPLListCoordinatorDelegate;

/*!
    An instance that conforms to the \c AAPLListCoordinator protocol is responsible for implementing
    entry points in order to communicate with an \c AAPLListCoordinatorDelegate. In the case of Lister,
    this is the \c AAPLListsController instance. The main responsibility of a \c AAPLListCoordinator is
    to track different \c NSURL instances that are important. For example, in Lister there are two types
    of storage mechanisms: local and iCloud based storage. The iCloud coordinator is responsible for
    making sure that the \c AAPLListsController knows about the current set of iCloud documents that are
    available.

    There are also other responsibilities that an \c AAPLListCoordinator must have that are specific
    to the underlying storage mechanism of the coordinator. An \c AAPLListCoordinator determines whether
    or not a new list can be created with a specific name, it removes URLs tied to a specific list, and
    it is also responsible for listening for updates to any changes that occur at a specific URL 
    (e.g. a list document is updated on another device, etc.).

    Instances of \c AAPLListCoordinator can search for URLs in an asynchronous way. When a new \c NSURL
    instance is found, removed, or updated, the \c AAPLListCoordinator instance must make its delegate
    aware of the updates. If a failure occured in removing or creating an \c NSURL for a given list,
    it must make its delegate aware by calling one of the appropriate error methods defined in the
    \c AAPLListCoordinatorDelegate protocol.

    once the coordinator is set on the \c AAPLListsController.

/*!
    Removes \c URL from the list of tracked \c NSURL instances. For example, an iCloud-specific
    \c AAPLListCoordinator would implement this method by deleting the underlying document that \c URL
    represents. When \c URL is removed, the coordinator object is responsible for informing the delegate
    by calling \c -listCoordinatorDidUpdateContentsWithInsertedURLs:removedURLs:updatedURLs: with the
    removed \c NSURL. If a failure occurs when removing \c URL, the coordinator object is responsible
    for informing the delegate by calling the \c -listCoordinatorDidFailRemovingListAtURL:withError:
    method. The \c AAPLListsController is the only object that should be calling this method directly.
    The "remove" is intended to be called on the \c AAPLListsController instance with an \c AAPLListInfo
    object whose URL would be forwarded down to the coordinator through this method.

    successful, then this method should call the delegate's update method that passes the newly tracked
    \c NSURL as an inserted URL. If the creation was not successful, this method should inform the delegate
    of the failure by calling its \c -listCoordinatorDidFailCreatingListAtURL:withError: method. The
    "create" is intended to be called on the \c AAPLListsController instance with an \c AAPLListInfo

    method would return false. Otherwise, it would return true. This method should only be called by
