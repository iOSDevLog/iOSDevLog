/*!
    An object that conforms to the \c AAPLListCoordinator protocol and is responsible for implementing
    entry points in order to communicate with an \c AAPLListCoordinatorDelegate. In the case of Lister,
    this is the \c AAPLListsController instance. The main responsibility of a \c AAPLListCoordinator is
    to track different \c NSURL instances that are important. The local coordinator is responsible for
    making sure that the \c AAPLListsController knows about the current set of documents that are available
    in the app's local container.

    There are also other responsibilities that an \c AAPLListCoordinator must have that are specific
    to the underlying storage mechanism of the coordinator. An \c AAPLListCoordinator determines whether
    or not a new list can be created with a specific name, it removes URLs tied to a specific list, and
    it is also responsible for listening for updates to any changes that occur at a specific URL
    (e.g. a list document is updated on another device, etc.).

    Instances of \c AAPLListCoordinator can search for URLs in an asynchronous way. When a new \c NSURL
    instance is found, removed, or updated, the \c AAPLListCoordinator instance must make its delegate
    aware of the updates. If a failure occured in removing or creating an \c NSURL for a given list,
    it must make its delegate aware by calling one of the appropriate error methods defined in the
    \c AAPLListCoordinatorDelegate protocol.
