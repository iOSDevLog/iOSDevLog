    Abstract:
    The implementation for the `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` type. This class is responsible for managing how a list is presented in the iOS and OS X app Today widgets, as well as the Lister WatchKit application.
*/

import Foundation

/**
    The `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` list presenter is responsible for managing the how a list's incomplete
    list items are displayed in the iOS and OS X Today widgets as well as the Lister WatchKit app. The
    `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` class conforms to `ListPresenterType` so consumers of this class can work
    with the presenter using a common interface.

    When a list is initially presented with an `IncompleteListItemsPresenter`, only the incomplete list items
    are presented. That can change, however, if a user toggles list items (changing the list item's completion
    state). An `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` always shows the list items that are initially presented (unless
    they are removed from the list from another device). If an `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` stops presenting
    a list that has some presented list items that are complete (after toggling them) and another
    `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` presents the same list, the presenter displays *only* the incomplete list
    items.

    The `IncompleteListItemsPresenter` can be interacted with in a two ways. `ListItem` instances can be
    toggled individually or using a batch update, and the color of the list presenter can be changed.  All of
    these methods trigger calls to the delegate to be notified about inserted list items, removed list items,
    updated list items, etc.

        that were incomplete when the presenter's list was set. Note that we've named the property

            First find all the differences between the lists that we want to reflect in the presentation of
            the list: list items that were removed, inserted list items that are incomplete, presented list
            items that are toggled, and presented list items whose text has changed. Note that although we'll
            gradually update `_presentedListItems` to reflect the changes we find, we also want to save the
            latest state of the list (i.e. the `newList` parameter) as the underlying storage of the list.
            Since we'll be presenting the same list either way, it's better not to change the underlying list
            representation unless we need to. Keep in mind, however, that all of the list items in
            `_presentedListItems` should also be in `list.items`.  In short, once we modify `_presentedListItems`
            with all of the changes, we need to also update `list.items` to contain all of the list items that
            were unchanged (this can be done by replacing the new list item representation by the old
            representation of the list item). Once that happens, all of the presentation logic carries on as
            normal.
