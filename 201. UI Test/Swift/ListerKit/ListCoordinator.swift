    The `ListCoordinator` and `ListCoordinatorDelegate` protocols provide the infrastructure to send updates to a `ListsController` object, abstracting away the need to worry about the underlying storage mechanism.

/**
    An instance that conforms to the `ListCoordinator` protocol is responsible for implementing
    entry points in order to communicate with a `ListCoordinatorDelegate`. In the case of Lister, this
    is the `ListsController` instance. The main responsibility of a `ListCoordinator` is to track
    different `NSURL` instances that are important. For example, in Lister there are two types of
    storage mechanisms: local and iCloud based storage. The iCloud coordinator is responsible for making
    sure that the `ListsController` knows about the current set of iCloud documents that are available.
    
    There are also other responsibilities that a `ListCoordinator` must have that are specific to the
    underlying storage mechanism of the coordinator. A `ListCoordinator` determines whether or not a
    new list can be created with a specific name, it removes URLs tied to a specific list, and it is
    also responsible for listening for updates to any changes that occur at a specific URL (e.g. a
    list document is updated on another device, etc.).

    Instances of `ListCoordinator` can search for URLs in an asynchronous way. When a new `NSURL`
    instance is found, removed, or updated, the `ListCoordinator` instance must make its delegate aware
    of the updates. If a failure occured in removing or creating an `NSURL` for a given list, it must
    make its delegate aware by calling one of the appropriate error methods defined in the
    `ListCoordinatorDelegate` protocol.
