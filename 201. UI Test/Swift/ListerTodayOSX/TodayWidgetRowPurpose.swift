    Abstract:
    The `TodayWidgetRowPurpose` enum and `TodayWidgetRowPurposeBox` class provide a way to represent the reason why a row is being displayed. The `TodayWidgetRowPurposeBox` class boxes an `TodayWidgetRowPurpose` enum to be represented as an object. The `userInfo` property of `TodayWidgetRowPurposeBox` is meant for binding to different properties (e.g. color) that is defined at initialization of the instance.
